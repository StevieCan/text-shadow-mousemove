Step by Step Instructions

1) Listen for a mousemove event on the hero class and when that changes, figure out how far and where we should put the text shadow. 
  - Inspect the webpage and look to see what the classes are defined and 
    what elements need to be called on.

2) In the script tag, get hero and text using document.querySelector and 
hero.querySelector.

3) Make a function for the shadow event.

4) Add an event lstener for the 'mousemove' that will run the shadow function.

5) Define the width and height within the function and set the parameters by adjusting offsetX and offsetY. 
  - Make sure that the target and this are the same. If different, then   make the necessary changes using an if statement. 

6) Style the text shadow using text.style.textShadow.

7) Can make necessary changes to the CSS if you'd like.
